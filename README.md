# Welcome!

![Legend of Talera](images/legend_of_talera.png)
Welcome to this fabulous text adventure! In _The Legend of Talera_, you are an adventurer that will collect different artifacts from places around Talera.

There are four skills you will get a level from 1 - 10 for. These skills are **knowledge**, **strength**, **charisma**, and **speed**. It may look something like this:
```
Your knowledge level is 4.
Your strength level is 6.
Your charisma level is 2.
Your speed level is 10.
Your average level is 5.5.
```
I would suggest that you write these scores down, as you cannot come back to them.

You will also get numbered choices. The right choice will depend mostly on your levels. It may look something like this:
```
Here are your options:
1) Fight
2) Run
3) Negotiate
```
These are the basics of this game. Happy playing!
